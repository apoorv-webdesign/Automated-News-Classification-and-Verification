BOMSBHELL: Clintons’ Fixer PROVES That Hillary’s Secret Affair Ended In The MURDER Of Her Lover Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
Hillary and Bill Clinton have had a sort of “fixer” for the Clinton’s that paid to make problematic issues disappear for the Clintons. He has finally decided to come forward and break silence on his experience, but for the some reason the Clinton’s have refused to deny a thing that he says. Even more shocking is when you take a closer look at Hillary’s ex-lover, it appears that he was shot in the head and Hillary’s odd behavior is having many claim murder. 
Many of those paying close attention to the Clintons’ suspicious dealings and sketchy behavior over the years have long since thought that longtime ally and lawyer Vince Foster was indeed having an affair with the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Well, Clinton’s fixer, Jeff Rovin, just confirmed these suspicions. 
Rovin admitted to Sean Hannity, on the record, that Hillary Clinton and Foster had indeed been having an affair for many years. 
This is especially interesting when we analyze the questionable circumstances of Foster’s death that was ruled as a suicide. Foster died of a gunshot wound to the head and a great deal of people who have analyzed the facts strongly believe that it was not a suicide at all, but rather murder. 
Rovin proceeded to run down this road without intending to when he described Hillary’s reaction to Foster’s death: 
He [Rovin] claimed to have helped scrub the office of Vince Foster to snatch documents related to the Whitewater scandal and covered up an alleged affair between Hillary and Foster. But Rovin told Hannity he was tasked with distracting the media while Hillary’s crew rummaged through Foster’s office. He also called the Hillary-Foster affair “pretty much an open secret.” 
It just seems too close to be coincidence. Miguel Rodriguez, the lead prosecutor in the case submitted a 2-page resignation
