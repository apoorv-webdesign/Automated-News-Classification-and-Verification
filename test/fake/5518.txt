From Bloomberg: London-based gold dealer Sharps Pixley Ltd. is running out of bars and coins as buying surges after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidency. The company’s store, a short walk from Buckingham Palace, has arranged emergency imports of Britannia coins and kilogram (2.2 pound) bars to meet demand. “We keep running out of product — we’ve had to increase our credit lines to allow us to keep more stock on site,” Norman said, keeping a customer waiting on another line. “Swamped!” The reality is that trading volumes have skyrocketed across the globe. In other words, physical gold demand is off the charts right now. It will be very interesting to see how long the central banks can restrain the price of gold in light of the skyrocketing physical demand.
