MP Hussein Ali Haji Degana said at least 12 officials, occupying high positions, were arrested on suspicion of spying, while, almost all of them participated in the signing of a nuclear agreement in 2015. 
Moreover, most of the detainees have dual citizenship. Thus there are citizens of the United Kingdom and Canada. But it is not yet known, if there are some US citizens among them or not. 
During recent times, there is evidence that Washington is going to avoid this agreement, that’s why Tehran continues to express its protest. Hussein Ali Haji Degana said that the White House would have to pay dearly for the termination of this transaction. 
In addition, one of the candidates for the next US Secretary of State, John Bolton, has called today for a "color revolution" in Iran. 
He said: «The only longterm solution is regime change in Tehran. The ayatollahs are the principal threat to international peace and security and the Middle East». 
Bolton added that Washington had to support and fund the opposition. 
Earlier, Iran has officially confirmed the presence of the IRGC intelligence personnel in the US and Europe. This fact also shows that Tehran has no confidence in Western countries and the unreliability of agreements signed with them. Related links
