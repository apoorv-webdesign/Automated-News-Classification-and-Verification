The EU-Ukraine summit starts. The main topic of this meeting is the discussion of anti-corruption measures, which are necessary for adoption of the visa-free enter for Ukrainians in Europe. Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Franciszek Tusk are going to participate in this summit. 
EU officials make no secret of the fact that Ukraine is clearly unable to cope with the task to extirpate the corruption. However, Poroshenko is expected to go on about his old, favorite issues. He thinks that the so-called, alleged Russian aggression and the situation in the Donbass, which were discussed yesterday at a meeting of the contact group in Minsk, would rouse the EU interest once again. But the problems and issues formulated by the EU are still waiting for a detailed discussion. 
Meanwhile, at yesterday's meeting in Minsk Kiev refused the "Steinmeier’s formula". However, it would not make this summit more productive.
