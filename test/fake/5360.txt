Israel’s Defense Minister to ‘Palestinian’ Paper: Hamas’ Next Attack on Israel will be its Last Oct 29, 2016 Previous post In an effort to communicate directly with the Palestinian people, Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman warned, in a rare interview with the Al Quds daily, that Hamas would be destroyed if it dares attack Israel again.
