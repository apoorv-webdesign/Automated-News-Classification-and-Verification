[VIDEO] Muslims Demand That Crosses Are Removed From A Catholic University Because They Find Them Offensive Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
Obama continuously claims that Muslims do not what to change our culture and Sharia Law is not coming to the United States. Yet, Yale Law School has opened up an Islamic Law Center for students to study Sharia Law and in Germany, an 8-month pregnant woman was beaten for wearing a cross, because it’s against Sharia Law. Now, a professor at a rival college is upset that Washington D.C.’s Catholic University of America has crosses covering the classrooms and does not have a designated space for their Muslim students to pray. 
Now, Muslims are complaining about crosses hanging up in the classroom of a Catholic University in Washington D.C. The complaint says that the crosses at the Washington D.C.’s Catholic Univeristy of America are “offensive” and prevent Muslims from praying within the vicinity of them. This may come as a shock to many, but it is just the latest occurrence of demands for the United States to implement and maintain Sharia Law adherence. The complaint was filed with the Washington, D.C. Office of Human Rights by a Professor Banzhaf from the rivaling college of George Washington University saying that there are in fact “too many crosses in every room of Washington D.C.’s Catholic Univeristy of America” which is a “human rights violation that prevents Muslim students from praying there.” Officials of the Washington D.C.’s Catholic Univeristy of America said that they were not aware of any complaints from any of the Muslim students who attended. 
Professor Banzhaf already has a pending lawsuit against Washington D.C.’s Catholic University of America for terminating its policy of mixed-gender dorms. Professor Banzhaf also has a rather long history of filing civil rights lawsuits on topics that range from smoking to childhood obesity. Part of the lawsuit states the Catholic University “does not provide space – as other universities do – for the many daily prayers Muslim students must make, forcing them instead to find temporarily empty classrooms where they are often surrounded by Catholic symbols which are incongruous to their religion.” 
Patrick Reilly of the Cardinal Newman Society was quoted as saying that “this attorney is really turning civil rights on its head. He’s using the law for his own discrimination against the Catholic institution and essentially saying Catholic University cannot operate according to its Catholic principles.”
