(King World News) From Jason Goepfert at SentimenTrader: 
Investors are starting to thaw Individuals in the AAII survey come roaring back to the bullish camp, a mixed blessing It takes a while for rapid changes in prices to be reflected in longer-term indicators, so some of the weekly series are just now reflecting the moves from the past 1-2 weeks. 
Among them, the weekly survey from the American Association of Individual Investors showed one of the largest two-week jumps in bullish opinion in the survey’s history. 
King World News note: Although the overall bullish opinion is still “muted,” the public is definitely increasing their appetite for stocks as the indexes hit new all-time highs. Of course this is the opposite of what we saw at the bottom of the stock markets in 2009.
