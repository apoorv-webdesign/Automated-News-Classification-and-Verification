Barack Obama chose not to interdict the supply lines of our enemies because the did not want to harm the oil tanker drivers, or cause an environmental issue. The proceeds of the enemy's oil sales were and still are used to purchase arms and material that wound and kill American Men and Women warriors and our allies. ISIS also uses the money to pay their sadistic, psychosexual predetor members who target innocent and vulnerable Men, Women, little Girls and little Boys for rape, enslavement, mutilation, unimaginably cruel torture and torment and of course murder.
Now that our enemy has blatantly used burning oil in a trench to kill people, which of course would constitute an environmental issue, perhaps Obama will begin to treat our enemies as the perverse, torturous murderers that they are.
