Lena Dunham Posts Video Celebrating the‘Extinction of White Men’ on Twitter Charlie Nash, Breitbart, November 3, 2016 
Both Lena Dunham and her father, Carroll Dunham, expressed their support for “the extinction of white men” in a bizarre video posted to Dunham’s Twitter account on Wednesday. 
“How are you feeling about the extinction of white men?” Lena asks her father in the video. 
“Well, white men are a problem. Straight white men are a big problem, that’s for sure,” declared Carroll. 
“But I actually feel pretty good about it,” he continued. “I think straight white guys have been screwing things up for long enough. High time for straight white males to step back and let some other people do it.” 
“That’s my dad!” replied Lena, as Carroll laughed.
