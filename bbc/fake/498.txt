WHAT? Leftist Protester Going Nuts On CNN Over Hillary Loss WAS A CNN CAMERAMAN? (VIDEO) shares Facebook 
Is CNN using their own crew members as fake protesters? Earlier today, we posted a video of a Hillary supporter having a total meltdown on CNN last night. 
In a slightly longer version of the clip you can watch below, CNN’s Don Lemon remarks at the end of the video that he knows the man and that he’s a CNN cameraman. 
Lemon says: 
“Brian, you know I used to live there and I know that guy, that’s John [last name]. He actually went to Africa with me as a cameraman but anyway, that’s another story.”

How does CNN ever recover their credibility after this election? 
They failed so badly!
