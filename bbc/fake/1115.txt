Yes, but the problem is, they don’t work. I have tried literally just about everything for my problems to no avail. Furthermore, so have many people with cancer and other incurable diseases to no avail. But this stuff really works. It cured Lisa Haven of a lifelong illness she has had to do with blood loss, cured her father of dementia, and is working for me. It also has cured people with cancers, etc. Don’t knock it until you try it – do as you wish, but all I can say is that I am EXTREMELY happy that I tried it. It’s working! God bless.
