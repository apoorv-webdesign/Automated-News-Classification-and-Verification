WATCH: Insane School Teachers Push Girls Into Snake Pit to Teach “Character Lesson” 
Their injuries were perceived as so severe by theme park staff and paramedics that Gavin Fuller of Queensland Ambulance described it as “incompatible with living.” 
The mother of Kate Godchild and Luke Dorsett, two of the victims, said that their family was “absolutely devastated” by the tragic and gruesome loss of their loved ones. 
“I have three children and have lost two of them today — my whole family has been wiped out,” the traumatized mother said.   
Dorsett’s partner, Roozi Araghi, was also killed in the incident, as well as a 42-year-old woman who has not yet been publicly identified. 
Authorities have been reviewing video footage of the attraction to see what exactly caused the deadly malfunction, but others who visited the attraction that day have noted that the ride’s seat belt situation was questionable. 
Jesse Lovett, a park-goer who was on the water attraction with his 2-year-old daughter an hour before the fatal accident, was concerned that the flimsy hook-and-loop strap wasn’t doing enough to keep them inside the raft. 
“It’s so rough and you had to hold it really tight … the strap did nothing and easily came undone because it was wet,” he explained.
