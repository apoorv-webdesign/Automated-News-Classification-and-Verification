Economics is Not a Science and is Not Based in the Real World 
In today’s world, economics is king. Everyone’s talking money and economy, yet none of it is actually even real. 
Award winning scientist, author, environmental activist, broadcaster, and geneticist, David Suzuki, gives us the thought provoking truth about economics. 
“Economics is not a science – it doesn’t even include the earth in its equations. Economics is not based in anything like the real world.” 
“Money now grows faster than the real world and economics is so fundamentally disconnected from the real world that it is destructive.” 
Here David Suzuki explains how conventional economics is a form of brain damage.
