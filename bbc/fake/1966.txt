I’m all for a recount, because it could do exactly what James suggests, puts the whole thing in chaos (and this is exactly what I said here before the election). I was furious when Al Gore simply gave up in 2000 when he should have fought on to the bitter end, and if there really are “irregularities” which would put this election in question, the people need to know that, even if it doesn’t actually change anything. Chaos is a very revealing state, and anything that elevates awareness of the farce that is our “two faces of a single coin” political system is good. 
Of course if one believes the election was totally rigged start to finish, then no doubt they would believe that this is just another act in the play already written, so probably would downplay it entirely. So, ironically, the people who most believe the election was rigged are the ones who care least about that being explored. Because that exploration is just as false as the election, of course. That’s an unfortunate position, I think, and in this case may just go to serve the purposes of the criminal elite; that’s the trap in that sort of absolutist structuralist thinking. 
I say stir it up, even if in the end it only provides for interesting theater.
