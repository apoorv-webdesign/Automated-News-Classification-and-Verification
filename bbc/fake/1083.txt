Now why am I not surprised? Countries which have allowed enough undesirable’s to immigrate, have been sucked in with the undesirables network of serious organised crime. Crime’s are largely committed upon non believers, as is the right these people have been bought up to believe they have. They are bought up to lie and cheat. It is human nature for pretty much everyone – is to have material things better than they would normally afford. Be it a nicer home, or some annual holiday or expensive motor car. Who does not like the better things in life? Well – these scheming thieves already have a network of bribed politicians, EU, law officials, high paid company executives etc – in their pockets. All from a share of the corrupt money they have stolen from Western Societies. And distributed a cut to money greedy people who are trusted in running our companies, States and Countries. With what I see going on with the likes of the EU – I am not surprised one bit with likely outcomes with the Clinton foundation. Oh – they come out with statements that they are fighting terrorism, yet they have been bribed to do as they are told – and actually let these undesirables help themselves to our money. And these undesirables funnel plenty of money to the very people our in power politicians pretend they are protecting us from. It is very much a catch 22 situation. They spend lots of money to fight ISIS, yet on the hand allow these people to help themselves to our purse – effectively supporting them. All due to our human nature of wanting more than our honest fair share. Our financial world is can of worms. Let’s hope a nasty world war is held off for as long as possible – as this is where we are heading – for whoever ends up in power. In the mean time – our people in power are turning our free Western societies into mini mayhems – and pretending they are doing good. All for MONEY.
