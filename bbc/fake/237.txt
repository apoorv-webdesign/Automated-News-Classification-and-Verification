I cannot believe this ahole has been released?? Duuhhh?? WTFrick? however he has since been released on a $5.2 million bail. The video at fist seems to capture the seemingly standard conversation between New Jersey police and a homeless man seeking shelter on a rainy day. The officers were responding to reports that a man was sleeping on the steps of Merdie's Tavern, unaware they were talking to Ahmad Rahimi. Rahimi is alleged to have injured 31 people when he detonated two bombs in New York and New Jersey last month. Moments after the conversation began Rahimi opened fire at Linden Police officer Peter Hammer and four other officers who had been called as backup. No one was killed in the shoot-out which followed, but everyone was injured, including Rahimi. The fugitive had given police the alias Ahman Khan and said he did not have any identification when pressed by officers.
