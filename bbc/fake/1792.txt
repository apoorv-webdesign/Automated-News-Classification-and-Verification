Given the Russians’ recent threats regarding the potential election of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, this is not good news. 
“Americans voting for a president on Nov. 8 must realize that they are voting for peace on Planet Earth if they vote for Trump,” veteran Russian politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky said earlier this month, according to Reuters .   
“But if they vote for Hillary, it’s war,” he continued. “It will be a short movie. There will be Hiroshimas and Nagasakis everywhere.” 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has himself reportedly also made threats, warning of a potential “confrontation” were Clinton to continue prodding Russia with allegations that it has been attempting to rig the U.S. presidential election. 
“Jeopardizing Russian-American relations in order to gain brownie points internally — I consider this to be harmful and counterproductive,” Putin reportedly said this week. “It’s not funny anymore. If somebody out there wants confrontation, this is not our choice but this means that there will be problems.”
