BNI Store Oct 27 2016 GERMANY: Gang of Syrian Muslim boys banned from swimming pool after sexually molesting girls as young as nine How about banning ALL Muslims? Police have launched an investigation after a gang of young Syrian asylum-seekers sexually harassed three schoolgirls at their local swimming pool. The girls – sisters aged 9, 11 and 14 – were surrounded and molested by seven Muslims, the youngest of whom was just seven. UK Express (h/t Terry D) The father of the schoolgirls said he had dropped them off at the swimming pool as a treat for the older girl’s 14th birthday. He said as soon as they started swimming they were harassed by the Muslim boys who surrounded them in the pool. The man said: “Five of the boys touched the girls’ breasts and bottoms.” He said his 11 year-old daughter managed to get away from the youths and ran to the pool supervisor to ask for help. Guess these girls didn’t have the “Don’t rape me” tattoos Germany has been giving out A police spokeswoman said the suspects were being investigated for sexual offences. She said one of the boys was 14-years-old and the rest were children between the seven and eleven. The spokeswoman said: “The suspects are said to have swam after the girls and to then have grabbed them.” The boys were all interviewed by police before being handed over to their parents after the incident in the Mariendorf district of Berlin. A spokeswoman for the swimming pool said the boys had all been banned for one year. (That’s all?) According to local reports, many girls have been victims of sexual assault by Muslim boys at the same swimming pool in Mariendorf.
