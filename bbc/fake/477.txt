How "unfit and Fascist" was Hillary in your mind, Karl, and was it "obvious"?
Did it worry you that she was the driving force behind two wars (Libya and Syria) and responsible for as many deaths as Bush Jr is for his wars?
There are plenty of other serious objections to Hillary, but mass killing really does have to top the list. Did you endorse her bloody efforts, that is the interesting question.
