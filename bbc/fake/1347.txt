President Obama’s 2013 Golf Trip With Tiger Woods Cost Taxpayers $3.6 Million   Source: Against Crony Capitalism 

Golf, as I have written before is a wonderful game. It is a thinking persons game. It is profoundly challenging and one can play it practically until they cart you away to the afterlife clubhouse. That Obama also likes golf is one of the few things on which he and I could (in theory) relate. (My usual go to with my “progressive” friends is classic rock. If one can drink a beer, keep one’s politics in check for a couple of hours and talk T-Rex and The Kinks we can be friends.) That he has played as much golf as he has in his presidency I also see as a positive. I’d rather have him wandering the fairways than getting all “inspired” back in the White House. 
But a $3.6 million golf trip in the taxpayer’s dime is just insulting.
