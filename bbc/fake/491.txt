Repeal national identity for a wholesome homogeneity in a New World Order run by benevolent elites?
This whole murderous nonsense stinks to high heaven of the Hegelian Dialectic. Assad is the problem, mass emigration of refugees the reaction. And a fractured Europe ripe for further globalization the solution.
I for one, am tired of being treated as an idiot without eyes, and being awake to the manipulation by the mass-murderers and their pet military trigger-pullers - prefer nationalism over an envisioned hell on Earth. But thank you so much for playing.
