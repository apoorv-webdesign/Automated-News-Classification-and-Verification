BNI Store Oct 31 2016 Do Canadian taxpayers know they are funding welfare for polygamous Muslim migrant families with up to 4 wives and countless children? Canadian Liberals have been stonewalling on any access to information requests relating to the Syrian Muslim migrants they’ve been shipping in by the tens of thousands . They’re either embarrassed by the facts or don’t even want to know what the facts actually are. Back in 2008, Toronto media left and right reported on hundreds of polygamous Muslim families in Toronto, many on welfare. Has anything changed? Neither Canada’s government nor its welfare agencies bother to screen for polygamous marriages. And the media won’t breathe a word about it.
