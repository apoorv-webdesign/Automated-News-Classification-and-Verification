Hillary Camp Caught on Camera Telling Tiny Crowd What to Cheer for 
The archer’s opportunity finally arrived on Oct. 8, when he went out to the field to hunt for prey . 
“When the deer came out, there were about 10 deer in the field,” he said. “I was sitting there and a 4-point came out and walked right underneath me and went in the bean field. About a minute later, (the 12-point buck) came out and walked right underneath my stand. 
Without a moment to lose, Stubblefield fired a shot. 
“He ran about 80 yards and just dropped,” Stubblefield said. “It was so dry, when he took off it looked like a smoke trail. He ran right out in the bean field and crashed. It looked like a bomb went off it was so dusty.” 
R.I.P. to the unnamed buck, though clearly he will not be forgotten anytime soon.
