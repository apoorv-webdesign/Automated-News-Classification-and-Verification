If you lost by more than five, you had to eat your paddle but you could use sauce. If you lost by more than 10, you had to eat your paddle with no sauce. A twin is only allowed to play against their twin. If the ball bounces off of the table but the dog picks it up, runs outside, trades it for another ball with the dog next door, and spits it back on the table, that’s inbounds. If your opponent accidentally hits it wrong because he’s focusing too hard on being a good host, the point is a redo. You’re not allowed to mention anything more fun than ping-pong. If the ball gets too close to you, you’re allowed to swat it away with your paddle. If you win the point in ping-pong, you win the point for real. Whoever gets to point 18 first gets to crack the ball a little and peek inside it. Serves only. If one player falls asleep during the point, they lose, but if both players fall asleep, the point continues in the dream. You have to win by one more point than the rules say you do. If the president knows about the game, both players lose. Get results Results for How Many Of These Unofficial Ping-Pong Rules Did Your Best Friend Insist On Using Growing Up?
