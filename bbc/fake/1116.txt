Amen!
GREED is a very real problem. So much so, that many an otherwise logical person will support such gouging exploits.
I DARE the makers of ‘provodite’ to release their cost of production. Look….people aren’t afraid to do it on the GREED fest that is the TV show, “shark tank” all the time…

Type in the phrase, “Miraculous Healing in Jesus Name” on youtube and see how God REALLY works. He doesn’t need the financial fruits of nutrition ‘science’ to get it done.
And He doesn’t require many dollars for a concoction of minerals that cost pennies on the dollar to produce.
Even water itself changes in molecular structure by FAITH….

There are those who are always seeking, yet never able to come to an accurate knowledge of the Truth.
Paying providite makers and their network of distributors exorbitant sums of money to obtain health is the equivalent of paying the “stupid tax” at a VERY high tax rate.
Be WISE. Eat right. Play right, and PRAY right and often….
And everything will work out right.
Blessings in Yeshua, Jesus Christ
