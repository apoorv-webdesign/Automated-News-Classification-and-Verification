6 Things That No One Tells You About Living Alone Posted today Email Time to move out and grow up. 
1. You can tie your shoes with the door open: Your whole life, you’ve been used to closing and maybe even locking the door when you tie your shoes. No longer! You can do it with the door open, and don’t need to put on a fan to cover the shameful sound. 
2. The newspaper doesn’t heat itself up: If you want some hot newspaper, you’re going to have to pop it in the microwave yourself. There’s no other way around it. 
3. If you used to live with Manny Pacquiao, there are probably fewer punching bags around now: Get ready to have a bunch more floor space if you no longer live with boxer Manny Pacquiao, never mind not having to worry about a punching bag knocking you over after a solid strike from the world-class champ. Our tip? Set up a small little punching bag if you ever start to miss living with the legendary Filipino fighter-politician. 
4. It’s a lot harder to get people to split your rent with you if they don’t live with you: This part of living alone is a pretty big bummer. 
5. The toilet paper goes bad: You can’t finish a whole 12-pack of toilet paper before it expires. When you live alone, you have to buy the four-packs or even the single rolls. 
6. No matter how loud you yell “Socks off!” no one is going to take them off for you: Ugh, seriously? Maybe living with roommates wasn’t so bad.
