I will be a camera and would like to know if there is any live streams for the Washington d.c. area. Can some one please post a time for those of us who do not even trust facebook. I have heard 7 and 12. I will go. I will love to learn and also support. I can take a hit and smile. I have extreme self control. I would gladly die with my body limp in the hopes some one else with step up behind me. My girlfriend said if some thing happens she would have a hard time not fighting we both agree that no matter if or if not life after life;then it will probably do some good so please do not start stuff this day. I believe that destruction of property may be needed but not yet. As some anon said above this can be a place for knowledge. We can grow this day. We can grow internally. We can grow our idea.i will look forward to meeting our family. You will be a great idea to see forming in a street. It is sad we have to meet mask to mask but i feel one day we will tell our kids we were there. We said no that day and i hope even more that one day we will be able to have the ability to say that to them. The only true hope at least one of the non- violent things you can do you do and be safe. Love and wishes
