ALERT: Clinton “Assault Weapon Ban” Resurrected… Gun Owners Beware 
Hillary for America speechwriter Lauren Peterson wrote to the Clinton camp on Jan. 14, 2016: “Marie Claire has partnered with Harvard on a study that looks at women and guns … and they’ve asked Hillary to contribute an essay on the subject.” 
Campaign political director Amanda Renteria referred to the column entitled “Yes, Guns Are a Women’s Issue” as “a great piece.”   
Director of engagement De’Ara Balenger echoed the sentiment but noted a potential point of concern: 
“Jordan Davis was killed by a white man, so arguably — this crime was racially motivated, which takes this outside the discussion of gun violence,” Balenger wrote. “Was there another mother in the Chicago meeting where the shooting was not racially motivated? If yes, we should use that story instead of Jordan Davis?” 
Policy adviser Corey Ciorciari made the campaign’s stance on using race to push their agenda clear in his response: 
“You know where I stand on this,” he wrote. “It can be racially motivated and gun violence should still very much be part of the discussion.”
