Before viewing the video, below, please be warned that its contents are truly disturbing. If you have children, have them avert their eyes so they aren’t forever scarred by the images of Clinton that decorate this person’s yard. 
This house in Bellmore!!!

The video of the house, posted on Facebook by Brian McKibbin, has gone viral, garnering over 2.5 million views in less than a week. Advertisement - story continues below 
The house was decorated with signs calling Clinton a “traitor,”“liar” and “murderer.” The house also featured several large displays encouraging people to vote for Republican nominee Donald Trump. 
It was unclear whether the person behind the decorations decided to do this for Halloween or just because he really doesn’t like Clinton . In any case, it really is an awesome display that works perfectly for both Halloween and the upcoming election. 
While this house might be scary, the real nightmare would be Clinton actually being elected. That’s why you need to get out and vote. If your state has early voting, go vote right away. 
We can laugh about this house’s anti-Hillary display all we want, but if she wins on Nov. 8, we won’t be laughing anymore. Advertisement - story continues below
