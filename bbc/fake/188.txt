I didn't know which one to do first or rather if I would but I did and not in chronological order either. Hello, My colleagues call me Captain Jack. My name is Jack Fearow and no not Captain Jack Spearow or was that Jack Sparrow? Anyways I'm new here but I'm no newb so don't expect me to believe a weather balloon is a Chinese lantern you know what I mean. Hopefully I reach out and touch a soul or 2 but if not I know I gave it me best. And that's the best I can do till we meet have a helluva bloody day!
