An online vigilante group in the United Kingdom, the Internet Interceptors, has helped the law deal with a 33-year-old pedophile who was planning to lure a 14-year-old girl to have sex with him in north London. The pedophile, Richard Ganyata, is said to be a Rugby player at Saracens Amateur RFC. It’s thought that he had met the underage 14-year-old girl online, proposing to have sex with her at his residence.
In a video chat with the supposed underage girl, Ganyata claimed to be 23-years-old. He told the girl that he lived at the club house of his rugby team. He then proposed that the girl visit him for sex, instructing the girl that if she arrives at the club house, she should pretend she was just his little sister’s friend.
He also told the girl how he planned to lay with her on the sofa, describing in detail what he would do to her during sex. The positive response from the girl excited Ganyata, who was looking forward to having a good time with the underage girl.
But unbeknownst to the pedophile, he had spoken to members of the Internet Interceptors instead – the team who dedicate their time to hunting down pedophiles on the Internet.
When the day came for the pedophile to meet the girl as planned, he went to pick her up, but rather than meet with her, he was confronted by members of the Internet Interceptors, who immediately called the police. The vigilante group filmed their meeting with the pedophile on camera.
A member of the group asked the pedophile: “You’re here to meet a 14-year-girl aren’t you, Richard?”
He replied: “I wasn’t really sure about it.”
