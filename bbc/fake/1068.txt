BNI Store Nov 2 2016 IN BRITAIN, Paki Muslim sex traffickers who rape and pimp out young white children go free but Christians who throw bacon at a mosque get thrown in jail Two British men have been jailed for going to a mosque and throwing bacon at a Muslim man in what the sharia-compliant British officials call a ‘callous hate crime.’ There you go, Londoners, keep on electing Muslim politicians and soon you’ll be stoned to death for insulting Islam. Metro Piotr Czak-Zukowski was found with an empty packet of bacon in his pocket when he was searched by police officers after the incident. He and Mateusz Pawlikowski had confronted worshippers at the Al-Rahman Mosque in Crowndale Road, Kings Cross, north London on October 2. BACON BANDITS Mateusz Pawlikowski and Piotr Czak-Zukowski Pawlikowski, 22, of Wilton Road, in Muswell Hill, north London, swore at a man and threw a rasher of bacon towards him, and chucked more bacon on the floor of the prayer room. The pair fled but Pawlikowski was detained near the mosque and Czak-Zukowski, 28, of Sneath Avenue, in Brent Cross, north London, was found at Camden Lock. Both men admitted criminal damage and a religiously aggravated public order offence last month. They were jailed for eight months at Blackfriars Crown Court. DC Tracey McMath, from the Camden Community Safety Unit, said: ‘The defendants showed a complete disregard for the faith and belief of others in this callous and highly offensive incident; and I hope their convictions highlight that we will not tolerate hate crime in any form.
