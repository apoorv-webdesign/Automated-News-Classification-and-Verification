The occupation eventually ended on Jan. 26, when the Bundys and other key occupiers were arrested at a traffic stop. One of the occupiers, Robert “LaVoy” Funicum, was killed during that altercation. 
Speaking with The Oregonian , the attorneys for the various defendants expressed satisfaction with the jury’s decision. 
“More than we could have hoped for,” said Morgan Philpot, one of the attorneys for Ammon Bundy.   
“Stunning,” added defense lawyer Lisa Ludwig, who was serving as standby counsel for Ryan Bundy. 
“I’m just thrilled,” chimed in Lisa Maxfield, an attorney for one of the five other defendants. 
There was just one problem. The Bundys were still expected to stand trial in Nevada for an earlier standoff that occurred several years prior. Moreover, U.S. Marshals present at the verdict hearing Tuesday reportedly had a retainer for Ammon. This led to an in-court altercation, and he was again placed in custody. 
This snafu aside, the ruling was, according to The Oregonian, “a remarkable blow to the federal government as it tries to tamp down a national movement … to open public lands to ranchers, miners and loggers.”
