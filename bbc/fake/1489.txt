A lot of these creeps are going to be looking to flee like roaches over to Syria. Syrian forces need to set up blockades to ensure they cannot slip in. And as far as after this city is liberated and free from Satan's grip, there doesn't need to be one power control structure implemented. I think this city is and should be a completely dynamically diverse and peaceful enclave. No power trips, no hate, no sectarian strife. Food, water, power, etc. those are all things every resident needs and wants and no government body can or shoud try to play tough guy. I honestly think Mosul can be the city of miracles. I really hope that all the nasty people that are salivating to move in and try to dominate this enclave will back off and contribute only good will and objective and benevolent efforts. It could truly be an amazingly beautiful, simple and harmonious place if only the evil troublemakers were not allowed to take root
