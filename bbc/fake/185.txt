Mexico Declares Marijuana Use “Human Right” In Supreme Court page: 1 The Mexican Supreme Court ruled by 4 to 1 that banning the consumption and cultivation of cannabis for personal use violates the human right to free development of one’s personality. … … Freedom To Smoke a Human Right. It's about damn time! For a long time now, people have been fighting for the basic human right of being able to consume whatever substances they wish, and do with their personal property (the human body) as they see fit. This is especially true of cannabis, which has a long list of medicinal benefits. In spite of its minor adverse effects (which pale in comparison to alcohol and cigarettes) people in the United States, and other parts of the world, are still being locked up for simply using the “miracle plant” to help combat disease and pain. Mexico, however, often demonized as being backwards by their Norther neighbors, has ruled that smoking marijuana should be a basic human right! edit on 26-10-2016 by Encryptor because: (no reason given) new topics
