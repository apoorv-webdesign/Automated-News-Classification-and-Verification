Judging by the ingredients ( http://www.vniinc.com/media/docs/prodovite_label.pdf ) I can say that it seems like a pretty healthy supplement.
BUTâ€¦.for 30 servings in one bottle that costs $85 freaking dollars, I could NEVER NEVER NEVER afford to buy this and respect myself afterwards. If this bottle was dropped down to maybe $35 or $40 then I would be willing to buy it.
GREED is a real problem.
