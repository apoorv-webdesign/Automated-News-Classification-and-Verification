Why oh why did they vote that POS Trudeau in. At least possible good news in Germany 3 parties are clubbing together and possibly the fat frau could be gone in a week. Mind you uk daily xpress always puts out rubbish headlines. Dont know who the Peto Party are in Germany but there are another bunch of traitors and strangely enough have 65% of the votes in one town where theyre using public dollars to build mosques. Germans need to break out the clubs on that lot
