Here is the problem . The USA constitution states only Congress can declare war yet Sanctions are a declaration of war made by non other than the bankster elite that has everrything to do with profit and nothing to do with defence . Far too much power for banksters to have and the profits they make are huge , The Office of Foreign Assets Control (&quot;OFAC&quot;) of the US Department of the Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on US foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the Unitedâ€‹ States.  It is an issue no one has ever adressed anywhere . So no matter who you vote for its the banksters who go to war and no one ever elects them .
