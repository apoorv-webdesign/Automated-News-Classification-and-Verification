CALIFORNIA Creepy Clown is a Muslim who nearly gets himself killed DAMN! “Nearly” doesn’t count. Guns.com (h/t Gary F) This week, Sadiq Mohammad thought he’d get in on the creepy clown craze – spooking employees at a Taco Bell drive-thru, creeping out a kid playing basketball, who incidentally threw the ball at him. But when he jumped out of some bushes – wearing his clown garb get-up – Mohammad was the one who got the biggest scare. The innocent victim didn’t take lightly to having the bajeezus scared out of him by a man in a clown suit and, after a brief verbal exchange, pulled out a handgun and knocked Muhammad in the head.
