If You Wanted a Thank-You Gift… November 5, 2016 
…from our late summer/early fall fundraiser for your donation of $125 or more — or if you set up a recurring monthly donation — and have not received the gift package yet, please send us an email at . 
The thank-you gift was the new edition of Robert Parry’s Trick or Treason (with a new afterword by the author), plus a DVD of PBS Frontline’s “The Election Held Hostage,” co-written by Parry. 
Or, if you didn’t get around to making a qualifying donation and still wish to, you can still get the book/DVD combination. Just visit our donation page to make a contribution. We’ll read a donation of that size as a request for the book and DVD. 
Thanks for all your support, PBS Frontline’s: The Election Held Hostage, co-written by Robert Parry
