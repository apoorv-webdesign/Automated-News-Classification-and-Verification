“Black lives don’t matter to Hillary Clinton. Black votes matter to Hillary Clinton,” he said.

America’s inner cities are a mess, and poverty and crime are decimating black families across America. Decades of Democrat leadership in major cities have done nothing to improve the lives of millions of black Americans. 
What Trump is offering is an alternative — a chance at a better future. All Clinton wants to do is promise more hope and change and then spend four years breaking her promises . 
Democrat solutions to inner city problems don’t work. Republicans may not be perfect, but they believe that every American can succeed if given the opportunity to do so. 
Trump wants to give every American a chance to succeed. He wants to rebuild the inner cities, bring back jobs and increase education so black Americans everywhere can escape the cycle of poverty and flourish. Advertisement - story continues below
