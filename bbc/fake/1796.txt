It is unclear at this point whether the bodies were strapped to the hoods to serve as a warning to the rest of their fellow Islamic radicals, or merely as trophies to serve as encouragement to other Kurdish fighters.   
Regardless, it was a clear sign that the bloody battle to retake Mosul was underway in earnest, a battle that will most certainly result in incredible bloodshed and loss of life on all sides. 
It is possible that the Kurds deliberately chose to strap the dead bodies of their foes on the hood of their vehicles as something of a “one-up” on the Islamic State group thugs, considering that those jihadists have used this tactic before with dead Kurdish fighters and captured Yazidi sex slaves who no longer served their purpose. 
This is sadistic and brutal and utterly atrocious, but war often is.
