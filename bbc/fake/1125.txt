Depression is caused by vitamins deficiencies but psychiatrists call them chemical imbalances in the brain.I too suffered from depression and was put on meds for a couple of years and the side effects of the medication I took were IBS and gluten and lactose intolerance,which I now have to live with for the rest of my life.
Three years ago I did a blood-test and found that my B12 level was 179 and a normal would be up to 600,but still my doctor wasnâ€™t convinced and he told me that I was borderline.So I started taking 1000mg everyday and my depression started to ease instantly.
You see, the problem with doctors is that they dont look at the real cause but only at the symptoms,they dont want to stop the cause,cos it will make you stop visiting,beside the fact that above all, the real cause before my B12 deficiency was that I recently had been through a traumatic situation and in order for the body to cope it releases cortisol and adrenaline which in turn eats up all your stored vitamins not just B12,so I also started taking magnesium and zinc as I also later discovered that I was also deficient in.
If you go back to your past before your the depression started you realize that there was trigger,say a bereavement of someone very close to you,a repossession of your house,news that a sibling has something terminal,in short, a very traumatic(shock) situation.
You said so yourself,you stopped taking and reoccurrence took place,which in turn means,you were doing what the doctor said,masking your problem,treating the symptoms and not the cause
