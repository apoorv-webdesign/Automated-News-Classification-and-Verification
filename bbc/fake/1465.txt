When we leave the Philippines this time (for good) remember to destroy both the naval base and the air base. We built them both with OUR money. Remember to return the area to its' pre American condition. No more US aid or financial assistance. I am certain that these industrious and entrepreneurial citizens will do splendidly without any further American "intervention"
