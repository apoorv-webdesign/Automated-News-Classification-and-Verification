Oh hey, I was the guy who started that plane tracking thread – https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/57×782/flightradar24com_offline_after_a_redditor_tracks/ . A week ago I put the final dot on the situation, since the Ecuadorian embassy seemingly validated that Assange is still at the embassy and doing well.
Now, 8 days later I come back to see what has changed, and to be honest, it looks like the situation hasn’t been crossed off as a “false alarm” yet.
