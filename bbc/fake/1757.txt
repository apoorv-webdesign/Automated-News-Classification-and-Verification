Sent by the Democrat candidate’s top aide Huma Abedin five months before Podesta asked about Clinton’s head, this email read as follows: “She’s going to stick to notes a little closer this am, still not perfect in her head.”

Critics have quite reasonably questioned Clinton’s health during this election season because of her persistent coughing fits and haggard look. Moreover, she was observed nearly collapsing to the ground during a Sept. 11 memorial event in New York City.
