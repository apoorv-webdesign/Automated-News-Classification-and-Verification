Benghazi Survivor Reveals Plan To Defeat Radical Islam 
Trenholm suffers from spina bifida, a birth defect that impairs the development of the spinal cord. It has kept the teen confined to a wheelchair for the past 10 years. 
Despite the inability to stand on his own , the boy has always been patriotic, his mother said, standing in his own manner whenever he sees the flag or hears the national anthem or Pledge of Allegiance. The teen even owns a number of pairs of leg braces emblazoned with a stars-and-stripes motif.   
The picture of young Trenholm standing as his school’s Junior ROTC color guard marched past was snapped by his uncle, Myron Leggett, a professional photographer. 
“He didn’t have to do that. He has an excuse to stay seated,” said Leggett. “Nobody told him, nobody encouraged him and he did it on his own. I admire him for that and I’m very proud of him.” 
The subsequent posting of the picture to social media brought a vast amount of attention, earning thousands of likes, comments and shares, even from national media outlets. 
This should serve as an inspiration to all those who are tired of seeing the flag and anthem and country they represent being disrespected by individuals pushing a divisive agenda.
