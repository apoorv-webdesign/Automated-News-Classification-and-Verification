To liberals, racism is at the heart of almost every action we take. If they think they can take something as stupid as holding a sign and make it a rallying cry for social justice warriors, they will. Of note: The person holding the “BLACKS FOR TRUMP” sign is white. pic.twitter.com/Bn3hJyiVZO

One Twitter user remarked that he had seen men holding “Nasty Women” signs while attending rallies for Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton, so he didn’t see what the big deal was. Advertisement - story continues below 
Because the internet is a truly wonderful place (sometimes), black Trump supporters started flooding Twitter with photos of themselves posing with Trump signs to counter the liberal narrative that no blacks support Trump. @TPuff44 @oliverdarcy there are black people next to her, I've seen males holding "nasty women" signs at HRC rallies..not a big deal

Despite what the media might want you to think, there are a fair number of blacks who support Trump . In fact, The Gateway Pundit reported that a series of polls indicated that Trump may receive more black votes than any GOP presidential candidate since Richard Nixon in 1960. 
If the liberal media actually did their job correctly, we wouldn’t even be hearing about this non-issue. Instead, because they are so desperate to avoid talking about the WikiLeaks emails that are hurting Clinton’s campaign, they will look for anything to distract the American people.
