Think Voter Fraud’s Not Real … These 23 States Say Otherwise 
Technically, there were zero “Soros-owned voting machines” in the United States. There were only machines owned by a company linked to Soros. 
According to the Epoch Times , a London-based company known as Smartmatic International has provided voting machines to 16 states this election season, and the chairman of this organization, Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, happens to be directly tied to Soros. 
“Malloch-Brown is on the board of the Open Society Foundations, run by Soros,” the international newspaper reported. “His brief biography on the Smartmatic website says he was also formerly the vice chairman of Soros’s Investment Funds and of Soros’s Open Society Foundations.”   
The Times added that “one of the easiest and most effective ways to alter the outcome of an election would be to gain access to a company that controls the voting machines,” as determined by a report published last month by the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology. 
The Daily Caller cautioned, however, that Soros has no “controlling interest in” Smartmatic International — and that the 16 states reportedly had no intention of using the company’s machines this election season. 
Despite Soros neither owning the machines nor having a “controlling interest,” it may nevertheless be a good idea just to get rid of the machines altogether. Why take any risks, given the massive importance of America’s election process?
