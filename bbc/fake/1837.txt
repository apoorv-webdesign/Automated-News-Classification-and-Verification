He believed the shelter, which was about 10 feet deep, could have been built during World War II after a German bomb landed close to where his home now sits. 
Marks said he bought the home from an elderly couple, who had built it in the 1970s. 
He added that the previous owner wasn’t too concerned about the shelter, as he had just covered it up. 
“He clearly wasn’t very worried about it and it just sat there until the hatch fell through. I think it’s great and I want to clear it out and preserve it if it’s structurally sound.” 
“It’s incredible to think it has all been made by hand. It’s part of our history, so it should be kept.” 
When he first started digging, the shelter was almost completely full of mud. After the area was cleaned out, Marks discovered glass bottles and old newspapers inside. 
Since some of those newspapers were much more recent than World War II, you have to wonder what else has gone on down there.
