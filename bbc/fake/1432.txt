So these men/women enlist under the promise to give them enlistment bonuses due to a corrupt individual making the promise to them (put into position by the President), they scam these men/women, some die, said corrupt individual is outed for presenting these scam deals and yet.... and yet the soldiers defending this country are made to pay for it?
Yeah....nothing is wrong with that at all Unreal....
The federal government bails out companies for the sums of billions and yet they can't take responsibility for their own hiring error here and help these men/women out who served the country for far less? It's okay though, let's give that money to illegals as they deserve it far more than those who defend this nation. Simply unreal...
