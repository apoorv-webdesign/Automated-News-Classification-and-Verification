As you might guess, it didn’t take long for people to point out just how sad and strange the tweet was. There's regular narcissism, then there's wish-yourself-happy-birthday & call-yourself-the-future-president-before-the-election narcissism. pic.twitter.com/cQnAl0Pr0O

It was just plain weird, as some users pointed out. @HillaryClinton Did you just wish a happy birthday to yourself? Weirdo lol 
Other users had a little fun with Clinton’s picture. @HillaryClinton I've seen that look before. pic.twitter.com/TQ7FaW7Mnr

Other users didn’t waste a moment getting down to the truth. @HillaryClinton happy bday to the single most corrupt politician in the history of the USA! #NeverHillary

Apparently the tweet was also promoted, which got under the skin of even more users. *Sigh* Why in the blue hell did I get a "Sign Hillary's Birthday Card" promoted tweet…I could NOT care less about her.

Clinton has always had a “people problem,” so it’s no surprise that the only way to get Twitter users to wish her a birthday was to promote a tweet. Advertisement - story continues below 
Clinton might have thought it was cute to wish herself, the supposed future leader of this country, a happy birthday, but what she has done is show us who she thinks is the most important person in the world — herself. And apparently she wants everyone around her to know it. 
Clinton’s problem with people is a serious one. Even those who have worked with the former secretary of state have said she isn’t exactly likable — and that’s putting it nicely. 
Clinton already behaves as though she is above the law. It’s almost unimaginable how dangerous such an unlikable, narcissistic person could be in the White House. 
Although I guess the last eight years have prepared us for it, at least a little. Advertisement - story continues below
