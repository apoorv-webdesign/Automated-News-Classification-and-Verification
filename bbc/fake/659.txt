Ammon Bundy and his older brother Ryan Bundy, both acquitted last Thursday of federal conspiracy and weapon charges in the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, are no longer in custody in the downtown Portland jail. 
The Bundys were discharged from the Multnomah County Detention Center about 7:45 a.m. Wednesday to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service, according to a jail spokeswoman. 
The two are being flown to Nevada, where they’re among 19 people indicted on federal charges in the 2014 armed standoff with federal agents over grazing rights near their father Cliven Bundy’s ranch. 
In Nevada, they face 16 felony counts, including extortion, obstruction of justice, conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, conspiracy to impede or injure a federal officer, assault on a federal officer, and threatening a federal officer.
