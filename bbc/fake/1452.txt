POTUS has treated our friends like enemies and our enemies like friends. I guess that's what hopeless chains is supposed to be though. The condition of urban schools has gotten much worse while 4 billion in cash goes to our mortal enemy, Iran. Yet urban blacks will still vote for Hillary. This I blame on the 3rd political party, Pravda, FKA the American media.
