"Woe to the fools."

You said in your heart, "I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of Mount Zaphon.
◄ Revelation 19:12 ►
His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself.
