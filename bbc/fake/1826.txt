The man sat on Trump’s star with the sign as people gathered around him, as you can see. Needless to say, there weren’t any liberals with sledgehammers showing up to do anything to Trump’s star this time. Advertisement - story continues below

This is liberal tolerance: If you disagree with someone, it’s all right to destroy property to express your displeasure. It’s OK to spend money that could be spent on Americans on illegal immigrants, just so long as those immigrants fit the liberal agenda. 
This is what liberals are all about: intentions. Never mind consequences. Consequences are for the heartless. Ignore the fact thatÂ our national debt is spiraling out of control, millions of Americans can’t afford health care and the Middle East is in chaos. Advertisement - story continues below
