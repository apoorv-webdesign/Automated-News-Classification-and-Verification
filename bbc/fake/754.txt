Is it better that we don’t know the true extent of Clinton’s mishandling of government documents? Is it better we don’t know the extent of her pay to play schemes? Is it better we don’t know the truth about the destruction of the legitimate government of Libya? Should we not know the ultimate destination of the arms and munitions, especially stinger missals removed from Libya? How about the disruption of an opposing political candidate’s political rallies and possibly the rigging of election ballot boxes? Is the destruction of cell phones and wiping of computers OK even if they held evidence of Clinton foundations wrong doing?
The list goes on. What does our government do? It silences the voice of truth and replaces it with the script of propaganda.
