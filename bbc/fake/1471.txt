Going to be fun watching the Philippine's turn into China's NEWEST province...
Remember when Subic Bay closed & the last U.S. ships sailed away?
It is going to be even SWEETER when the U.S. Embassy closes & the visa section flies away...
Filipinos are arrogant in their ungratefulness, all the while demanding even more...
We here in America are sick & tired of Filipinos...
Time to set these ingrates adrift permanently!
