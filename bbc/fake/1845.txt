When researchers moved a marble covering that had been in place since 1555, according to Newser , they uncovered the stone slab. 
National Geographic archaeologist Fredrik Hiebert was elated.   
“The marble covering of the tomb has been pulled back, and we were surprised by the amount of fill material beneath it,” he told National Geographic . “It will be a long scientific analysis, but we will finally be able to see the original rock surface on which, according to tradition, the body of Christ was laid.” 
The Edicule and the interior are being restored by a group of scientists from the National Technical University of Athens under the leadership of chief scientific supervisor Professor Antonia Moropoulou, who looks forward to the day when their research can bring the interior chamber to exact replication of what it would have looked like in the time of Christ. 
“We are at the critical moment for rehabilitating the Edicule,” she told National Geographic. “The techniques we’re using to document this unique monument will enable the world to study our findings as if they themselves were in the tomb of Christ.” 
That is truly amazing.
