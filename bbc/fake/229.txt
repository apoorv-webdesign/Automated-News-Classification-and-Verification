Can anyone help with the meaning behind a mystery playing card? page: 1 link Trying this again My son found a playing card on his college campus. The back was a fairly normal design except it looks like the Facebook logo right in the middle. The front is the 8 of Diamonds with the words "The truth is out there" and "The Path of Light" written on it...also a couple of symbols drawn on it. We were wondering if this has some known meaning that anyone recognizes or maybe its just the rambling scribblings of someone with too much time on their hands. I tried to cross reference path of light and 8 of diamonds with the X-Files, but didn't come up with anything. I'll post a couple of pics as soon as I figure out how.
