Appearing at a concert for Hillary Clinton in Ohio alongside Chance the Rapper, Big Sean and her husband Jay Z, Beyoncé let us all know why she’s “with her.” 
After explaining that she was so happy her nephew got to have Barack Obama to look up to and know he could one day be president, Beyoncé then explained that this election is continuing on that path of progress. She explained that gender goes beyond that of any religion or race, and electing the first woman president is something she wants for her daughter. She said: 
“I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and know that her possibilities are limitless.” 
Electing Hillary Clinton would break the mold of the United States being led by only men since its inception. However, that’s clearly not the only reason to elect Hillary. She is, by far, the most qualified person to run for President of the United States in more than a century.
