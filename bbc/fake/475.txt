Hyperbole is odious.
This is not a bad article for the most part, but the title, "Will America Survive the Next 4 Years?" , and the words in the last paragraph, "it seems entirely doubtful that the country will make it through four years of Donald Trump" , are clickbait silly.
If America could survive Slick Willie Clinton, Bush Jr., and Obama/Hillary (even though millions of foreign people did not survive their regimes), then it will survive Mr. Trump.
There is even a fair chance that Trump will not be worse than his predecessors.
