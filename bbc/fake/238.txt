White students had to bypass the bridge by crossing a rocky stream, hopping from one stone to the next. Anyone who tried to push past the human barrier was immediately met with violence and hostility. “This is bigger than you! This is about whiteness,” the protesters cried. UC Berkeley SJWS Build Human Wall to BLock White Students from Campus Nice Video in the link. They never actually say that whites were not allowed to cross the wall but you can clearly see in the video they let people of color through while making white students walk around. Pretty nuts. One more reason I don't believe in the education system. So many self entitled 20 year old toddlers who piss and moan when life gets rough. Then take it out on whitie and the police. What a joke. If they blocked me anybody who stood in my way would be eating blended meals through a straw for the next couple of months. The average human punch can generate 178 pounds of pressure or force. It takes 10 to 13 pounds to break a nose and 40 pounds to dislocate someones jaw. I have done both and im very good at it. Then to get to class, one may need to keep a rainbow kerchief or Cherokee flag handy and play a role. SJW racists are basically dolts and can be readily outwitted.
