This looks like a fake letter. Especially this part; "His analysis is impeccable and his grasp of facts masterly. And his writings are devoid of any prejudice against any ethnic group or nation."
Hall's "analysis" is laughable, his basic understanding of the ideas he talks about is vapid, and he clearly voices prejudice against an ethnic group, in fact he relies on prejudices against an ethnic group when he uses the 'dual - loyalty Jews' argument as 'evidence' that Israel was involved in 9/11.
