LOL! Social Justice Warriors Were Triggered By This â€˜GENDER IDENTITYâ€™ Joke On Saturday Night Live shares Facebook 
Saturday Night Live definitely leans left, they love to make fun of conservatives. But every once in a while they poke fun at the left. In this case, they made a joke about gender identity on the dating application Tinder. They also pulled the election into it. 
In case you didnâ€™t see it, hereâ€™s the joke: 
Social justice warriors on Twitter were not happy: What the fuck is this @SNLUpdate pic.twitter.com/Q3PTZghM5g

â€” Sam Escobar ðŸ‘» (@myhairisblue) November 21, 2016 Dear @ColinJost and @nbcsnl : thank you so much for supporting the erasure of non-cis people. Thanks for actively contributing to oppression. 
â€” Sam Escobar ðŸ‘» (@myhairisblue) November 21, 2016 @ColinJost i don't think, as a professional comedian, it can possibly escape you how this joke is punching way way down. 
â€” Emma Phipps (@phippsdontlie) November 22, 2016 @ColinJost You wish you had a point. Instead it's just tired old LGBT-shaming disguised as edgy commentary. 
â€” Louis Virtel (@louisvirtel) November 22, 2016 The fallout of this election has been a beautiful destruction. Intolerance is everywhere and it is eye opening to the masses. https://t.co/BbdFsO1Frh And before you say its "just a joke," here are 2 reminders:1) jokes like these normalize oppression2) SNL doesn't know how to write jokes.

Lighten up, snowflakes! 
The actor in the skit ultimately responded: @PWRBTTMBAND so you think 100 percent of Trump voters were hatred and 0 percent had any other rationale? 
â€” Colin Jost (@ColinJost) November 22, 2016 @PWRBTTMBAND It's politics. A lot of politics is messaging and getting America on board. I want to examine how we failed at that goal. 
â€” Colin Jost (@ColinJost) November 22, 2016 @PWRBTTMBAND I worry about not doing any self-examination and making the same mistake again.
