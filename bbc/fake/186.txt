link At various times of year, Bureau of Land Management Fairbanks District Office Public Affairs Specialist Craig McCaa likes to go down to the Chena River to share photos of changing Fairbanks weather. On Oct. 18, he decided to walk his camera down to the University Avenue bridge that crosses the river to snap a few pictures of ice forming on the water's surface. But instead of finding just snow and ice, McCaa saw a "strange thing" moving back and forth in the current of the murky river. "It never fully revealed itself," he said in a phone interview Tuesday. McCaa took a video and posted it to the "Bureau of Land Management – Alaska" Facebook page Tuesday afternoon. By evening it had been watched about 20,900 times. Speculation has run rampant on what the creepy object — or creature — swaying in the water might be. This is really wild. What could be this big and swim in this style in Alaska? I'm looking for ideas and don't suggest any bias from this post. www.adn.com... aska-life/2016/10/26/string-sturgeon-or-sea-monster-chena-river-creature-baffles-internet-observers/ edit on 27-10-2016 by bryan2006 because: (no reason given)
