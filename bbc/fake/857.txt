Share This The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports that 300 Daesh child soldiers were killed in Mosul operations. They believe the children were brought to Mosul from Syria. It is unclear if these deaths have already been counted in official figures. The first Christian mass in two years was held on Sunday in the Christian village of Qaraqosh , which is also known as Hamdaniya. However, many Christians doubt they will ever return to their homes. The village of Ali Rash was liberated . Kanona and Rozbian were also freed , as were about 11 villages west of Mosul, including Amrini, Ayin Al-Baiyza, Jarn, Mad Al-Dibaj, Mistanqaâ€™ al-Thanya, Qariya Al-Shik, Salmani, and Zarka. Also freed were Faziliya, Kani Shirin, Khadheir, Kevrok, Khrab Bet, and Qabr Esaaq. Militants have trapped 7,000 civilians in Anah . At least 255 people were killed and 60 were wounded:
