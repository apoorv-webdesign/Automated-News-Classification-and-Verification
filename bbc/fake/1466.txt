The Philippines are doing just fine since kicking the US out under Clinton 1, with now one of the highest growth rates in Asia. They also continue to hold 'special visa' privileges, entering US through Guam, then taking US government and healthcare jobs all across America. What is destroying PI is Chinese drug triads, what is saving PI is Chinese R/E funding, so Duterte must draw a fine line in the sand. The US provides PI nothing. Your post is an absurd statement.
