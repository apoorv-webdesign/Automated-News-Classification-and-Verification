In the first half, teacher and writer Benjamin Dancer , the Director of Public Relations for the Colorado EMP Task Force (Peter Pry's organization), discussed the vulnerability of the US power grid. He explores the threat in his new novel in which a villain tries to sabotage the grid with a sophisticated cyberattack. Mass casualties would likely occur if the power grid goes down for an extended period, with increased sanitation issues, he noted. Dancer also pointed out that the approximately 100 nuclear facilities in America are dependent on electricity to run safely. While they do have emergency generators that run on diesel, once that fuel is depleted, we could be looking at multiple Fukushima situations, he cautioned. 
Meteorologist Sandy McDonald briefly joined the conversation to talk about his paper published in the journal Nature Climate Change. He proposes developing a widespread wind and solar program across the continental US with the energy transmitted over an underground high voltage direct current line, that would be protected from solar storm damage. His proposal brings both the right and left political spectrums together, by connecting the issue of sustainability with the existential threat posed by our power grid's vulnerability, Dancer commented. Besides hardening the grid, another option would be for the US to choose a more sustainable population size that would not be so dependent on electricity for its food sources, Dancer added.
