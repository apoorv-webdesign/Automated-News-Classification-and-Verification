a reply to: IAMTAT I like knowing that the powers of good are working quite effectively in the background. This election has opened up so much in the way of "conspiracies" that the average person paying even the slightest bit of attention have been exposed to how it actually works. I think we will continue to see this corrupt beast system brought into the light, regardless of the election, the elite have lost control. I really hope you're right. MY eyes have been REALLY opened to the corruption and the control. THIS election is about consolidation of a long construction of establishment/outside interest corruption spanning decades and both parties. It needs to be brought down before the cement hardens.
