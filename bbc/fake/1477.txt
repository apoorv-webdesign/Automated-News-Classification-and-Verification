It is interesting that Duterte got something like 3 billion from China, and now he is getting money from Japan. He seems to be getting a lot of money for his country. I just hope he does not sell out the Philippine resources, minerals, water way rights etc. Duterte really should not blame America for all the problems in the Philippines. What caused the Philippines a lot of problems was the corruption and bribery that took hold of his country.
