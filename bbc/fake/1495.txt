The Jews hold moral, historical and legal title to all Jerusalem including the Temple Mount. Zion, the City of David, the Apple of God's eye. The Islamos are interloping squatters there and I'm surprised Israel tolerates their presence.
There is also no history of anything called a palestinian people, language or culture. The argument is a 70 year old MB political construct simply to justify continual war against Israel.
Only one state solution exists: Israel.
