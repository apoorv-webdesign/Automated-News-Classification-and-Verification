Images reveal crashed Schiaparelli Mars lander page: 1 link We knew as time passed that Schiaparelli had failed in its mission to become ESA's first working lab on mars , now the efforts of ESA to locate their missing lander have provided the proof that Schiaparelli crashed on Mars , as suggested by the data returned before the event. If at first you don't succeed Looks like an impact crater to me. Mars succ√®s rate is all told about 50%? originally posted by: gortex the efforts of ESA to locate their missing lander have provided the proof that Schiaparelli crashed on Mars R.I.P Schiaparelli, you never even got a chance to reveal some of the secrets of Mars. Okay, we're on a conspiracy site, i'll say it... Looks like an impact crater to me. Schiaparelli's impact. NASA have a good success rate landing on Mars probably due to them being well funded , in comparison ESA don't seem to have all of their ducks in a line to be able to take the next step. Shame really as we are going looking for life where NASA seems content to look for the conditions that would have allowed life to start. originally posted by: gortex NASA have a good success rate landing on Mars probably due to them being well funded , Shame really as we are going looking for life where NASA seems content to look for the conditions that would have allowed life to start. Nasa does have a good success rate, Curiosity's wacky landing putting the cream on the cake, since it obviously worked. Ihave to say though it's kind of weird that there were two failed events. The chute, then the rocket in the next sequence one aiding the other sort of, (I'm assuming that the rockets would have fired in a controlled fashion but then cut off prematurely) edit on 27-10-2016 by smurfy because: Text.
