BREAKING: Trump Takes Lead In Battleground State Of Florida 
“We have a record number of people registered to vote in Texas. Weâre having record turnouts, the first day, the second day of voting,” Miller said. 
“And itâs not Bernie Sanders supporters coming out to support (Democrat nominee) Hillary (Clinton). Itâs not (President) Barack Obama supporters coming out to support Hillary. Itâs a new surge of Trump voters, many who have never registered to vote,” he continued. “Many who have not voted in eight or 10Â elections so theyâre not reported in the polls.” 
Miller then said he had proof that the polls are being rigged. His proof comes amid Trump’s claims that the election was being rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton.   
“I know for a fact that the polls are off because they oversample Democrats by 8,Â sometimes up to 16Â percent, oversampling Democrats. Theyâre oversampling women by 5 to 8 percent,” Miller explained. 
“So the Republican vote is underreported. Plus there is no way to sample this extra 20Â to 25percent of new voters that are Trump voters. Theyâre not Republican, theyâre not Democrats, theyâre pragmatists. Theyâre tired of the status quo and they want change.”
