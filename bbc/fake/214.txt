Heartless Trump cuts sweet old granny's water supply page: 1 link A 92-year-old Scottish widow is forced to drink stream water she collects in a wheelbarrow because Donald Trump refuses to fix the damage caused by builders working on his Â£1billion golf course. Grandmother Molly Forbes, 92, has refused to leave her cottage on the edge of Trump's golf resort in the tiny village of Balmedie, on the Aberdeenshire coast. The property developer and presidential hopeful, 70, has consistently tried to move Mrs Forbes and her son Michael from their home, which he has branded an 'eyesore'. Only a cold-blooded monster like Trump would be capable of something like this. He's been systematically bullying this innocent silver-haired grandmother to force her out of her property. Not only has he forced her to collect water daily at her frail old age, he is also keeping her from having a good night's sleep: Mrs Forbes says she has been subjected to an appalling campaign of intimidation, which allegedly includes cutting off the water supply to her property, floodlighting her bedroom window at night so she cannot sleep and building a massive wall against her property. She also claims security guards have tried to intimidate her by appearing at all hours of the day and night. Despite all this, she is determined not to be driven out. Source What is this vile man going to do to her next? Grope her? We must do all we can to support this sweet old granny and her son on their battle against ruthless Trump, and Trump must be forced to repair her water and leave them alone. This has gone too far! If this isn't proof that Trump is pure evil, I don't know what is. (Did I do this right?)
