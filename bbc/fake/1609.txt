The king of scientific takedowns, NDT doesn’t mess around. 1. When he took down a climate-change denier on Twitter. 2. When he was a guest on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert and claimed, “Creationists have a right to their beliefs, and I have a right to my belief that the most famous comet of all time is coming to send them all to early graves. Get ready for a peer-reviewed ass clobbering at the hands of frozen ice and rock.” 3. The time he went on a Twitter rant about Donald Trump. 4. The time a guy was blocking his driveway. 5.The time someone called him ugly. 
Holy crap! Looks like when Neil gets pissed, he gets REALLY pissed. We love you, Neil, but please keep Halley’s Comet up in space where it belongs.
