President Barack Obama has stood behind Hillary Clinton through every step of the FBI investigation into her use of a private email server as his Secretary of State. He has turned a blind eye to her many crimes and has encouraged investigators to let her off the hook. 
Just when Americans thought he couldn’t get any more corrupt, video footage has surfaced of Obama calling on illegal immigrants to vote today. 
The clip below shows just how far Obama is willing to go to push his own agenda—an agenda that Clinton has promised to protect and push forward. 
His comments, like his entire administration, are lawless. This is outrageous. 
Do you agree?
