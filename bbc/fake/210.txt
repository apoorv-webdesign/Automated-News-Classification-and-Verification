Mary Rodwell's New Book The New Human page: 1 link Go ahead and spout this is Project Camelot it's BS. You'll be wrong. Go ahead and call Mary Rodwell a liar she's just doing this for the money. You'll be wrong. This is what I have to say to open-minded individuals reading this: Put your seat belt on! In this interview, hypnotherapist and regressionist Mary Rodwell talks about the contents of her new book, The New Human , which apparently is soon to be released: For experiencers looking for a resource where you'll be treated with respect and have a chance to communicate, the organization Mary talked about in the interview is FREE, for Foundation for Research into Extra-terrestrial Encounters. link a reply to: ConnectDots No offense but these people just sound completely full of sh*t. They present no evidence of anything but talk wildly about stuff that I don't even think they understand and use words that just sound interesting but are totally made up BS. They just talk to other crazies and kids and believe anything they hear and then repeat it. Gee, some little kids tell you they don't like school or don't get along with other kids so that makes them multidimensional space kids with mental powers???? Come on They love to drop cool sounding phrases built from psudo scientific jargon but I don't think they even understand what the words mean. They talk about telepathy and mental powers and stuff but do they have any evidence of it or just a bunch of stories made up from kids and crazies???
