BREAKING: FBI Dir. Announces Shock “Database” to Monitor Cops 
However, after a county Democrat official who was also a gay activist received one complaint about Walsh, Walsh was summarily fired by the agency. 
Walsh responded by filing a lawsuit against the state, alleging discrimination, which in turn met with an official demand that he turn over all of his sermons , related notes and a host of other documents, a demand he is resisting and that his legal team called “an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church.” 
A statement from Walsh read: “No government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons. I cannot and will not give up my sermons unless I am forced to do so.” Advertisement - story continues below 
Walsh has been supported in his resistance by Dave Welch , one of the Houston pastors who was similarly targeted, who stated, “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but Georgia’s demand is even worse than when the mayor of Houston demanded 17 different categories of materials, including sermons, from … us.” 
“First, this is state government coming after a pastor, not just a rogue mayor in one city,” Welch explained. “Also, the state is demanding much more material: sermons, sermon notes, all documents without even topical or time limits. It could even include margin notes in this pastor’s preaching Bible. It’s almost as if they are ransacking the pastor’s study.” 
“This sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor, every church, every denomination and every citizen of faith in America,” he added. 
Walsh has also received support from the Concerned Women for America organization, with CEO Penny Nance saying, “The words of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that ‘(i)njustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere’ still reverberate today – especially as we witness the Gestapo-like tactics of his native state.” Advertisement - story continues below
