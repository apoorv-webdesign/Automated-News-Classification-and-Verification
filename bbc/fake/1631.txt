1st Half: What really happened to Marilyn Monroe? Filmmaker and artist, Paul Davids , joins George Knapp to reveal newly declassified FBI and CIA files, proving that her troubles were not all the product of her abuse of prescription drugs and failed marriages, but began with her wedding to Communist-leaning playwright Arthur Miller as she was targeted and tormented by the FBI, CIA and Mafia.
