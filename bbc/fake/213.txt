I declare myself a conscientious objector page: 1 link With tensions as they are and a war on the horizon I have decided to declare myself a conscientious objector. The UK does not need to start a war in Syria, it does not need to start fight with Russia. None of that has any reliavance to the UK or its saftey! In fact it would make us more unsafe! War in these curmstances would not be for my defence. And in my opinion violence is only nessary or justified in self defence. Russias leaders have acted disgrafully. But our leaders in the USA and UK are equally as bad. For every Crimea there's a Iraq, for every Syria a Libya. There is no moral high ground, the USA or UK has no right to point fingers, nor does Russia. I will therefore refuse to support (directly or indirectly), take part in or contribute (beyond taxes) anything. My only exception being unarmed medical services that I will give neutrally to BOTH sides equally. In the unlikely event of a call up I will choose prison. I will not actively support or aid the other side beyond medical and humanitarian aid. Call me a traitor, a coward or anything you like, this is my decision . I want NO part in any looming conflict. edit on 27-10-2016 by crazyewok because: (no reason given) edit on 27-10-2016 by crazyewok because: (no reason given)
