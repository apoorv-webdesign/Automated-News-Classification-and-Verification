According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, around 300 Syrian children, recruited as child soldiers by ISIS, have been killed over the past two weeks in fighting in and around the Iraqi city of Mosul. The brigade is called the “cubs of the caliphate.” 
Locals reported that the loss of children in fighting around the Syrian town of Daquq was spun by ISIS religious leaders as minor compared to the gains they would secure in Mosul. The fighting is fierce around Mosul, and the casualties are high. 
The Observatory said that at least 480 Syrian fighters had been killed in fighting around the Mosul area since the fighting began two weeks ago. This means that a strong majority of those casualties were actually children. 
The US has claimed they believe between 800 and 900 fighters have been killed overall around Mosul. This indicates that the fighting outside of Mosul is heavily between invading Iraqi forces and ISIS’ Syrian auxiliaries. Large numbers of ISIS fighters are believed to have remained within Mosul, preparing to defend the city itself.
