BREAKING: Clinton Fixer Reveals Sick Smear Hillary Ordered Against Monica 
But he saved his most serious condemnation for the Democrat nominee. 
Huckabee stated that Clinton had always been “surrounded by people who have never told her no.” Just like a child who always gets her way, there needs to be someone willing to take on this problem child and offer the discipline she so desperately needs. 
“Is there any Republican who has breath left who could stand back and let that happen, without doing everything they can to stop it, and the only roadblock to that level of corruption that could forever taint our government is Donald Trump?” Huckabee continued.   
Then he really broke it down… 
“She lies to Congress … she treats foreign governments like they’re a piggy bank for the Clinton Foundation … she violates the law whenever she wants … she uses the government agencies like the FBI and the IRS to go after her own personal opponents. I don’t think Hillary could give a rip for people who are out there lifting heavy things and getting their hands dirty and greasy — she looks at them … as people she could put in her basket of deplorables.”
