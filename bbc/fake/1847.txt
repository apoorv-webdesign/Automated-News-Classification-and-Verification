On Thursday, Trump revealed that his wife, Melania , had agreed to give several speeches on his behalf — something she hasn’t done since the Republican National Convention in July.   
“She’s actually going to make two or three speeches,” Trump told “Good Morning America” host George Stephanopoulos. “She’s amazing when she speaks. She’s an amazing public speaker.” WATCH: "[Melania] is actually going to make two or three speeches."– Trump on Melania on the campaign trail https://t.co/2SykRNHMgh

Melania has been quite popular, particularly among conservative women who have described her as “classy,” “beautiful” and “well-spoken.” She has also appealed to immigrants, as she herself came to the United States from Slovenia. 
While we’re not completely sure this is the “surprise” Giuliani was talking about, it certainly seems like it fits his description of an unsuspected campaign move.
