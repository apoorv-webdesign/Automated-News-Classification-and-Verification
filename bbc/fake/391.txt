We abide by the highest standards of creative writing and intend to make this site as respectable as possible to the extent allowed by our fertile mind. We welcome comments, but please bear in mind that this is a family-oriented site. We reserve the right to edit or censor any comment that we deem inappropriate or funnier than our posts . 
We also welcome reposts of our stories but request appropriate credit to The Adobo Chronicles. We cannot be responsible for reposts without credit as they may be taken in a context outside of the original intent of this website. (Yeah we know, that was quite a mouthful!) 
Why the title, “ The Adobo Chronicles ,” you might ask? Well, adobo is the national dish of our home country. You see, adobo is usually made with pork or chicken, boiled and simmered in a mixture of vinegar, soy sauce and other spices. When writing stories for this blog, we let the news sizzle and simmer in our mind in a mixture of fact and fiction, then we spice it up with figments of our imagination. 
NEW FORMAT: The Adobo Chronicles has recently adopted a new format to help readers distinguish between fact and fiction. Statements and paragraphs in our posts that are in italics represent the facts. The rest are fiction. 
Unless indicated otherwise, all images are by us or from public domain. Use of images and information from public domain are in accordance with the fair use doctrine as it applies to news, parody and the Internet. No copyright infringement is intended.
