Australia Admits Gun Control Failure! Offers Amnesty to “Offenders” 
Gallup has been asking Americans about their opinion on the assault weapons ban since 1996 — two years after President Bill Clinton signed a federal assault weapons ban. That year, 57 percent of those polled said they favored the ban. 
But in 2006, the poll found for the first time that more Americans opposed the ban than favored it, and that opposition has typically increased over the past 10 years. 
What was most interesting about the results, however, was that the sharp uptick in those who opposed the ban came from Democrats, 50 percent of whom said they would not support a ban on assault weapons.   
Less surprisingly, 75 percent of those who identified as Republican said they opposed the ban. 
These numbers are detrimental to the progressive agenda of Obama and Clinton, who have made gun control , particularly a ban on assault weapons, a key issue. 
The truth is that most Americans know that our constitutional right to bear arms is imperative to our continued prosperity as a nation and that an infringement upon that right is dangerous.
