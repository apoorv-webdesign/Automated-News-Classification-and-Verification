a reply to: corblimeyguvnor My current avatar is in celebration of Doctor Who Day, the 23rd of November. I have to agree, Tom was also my favourite of the oldies, and Peter Capaldi is my favourite of the reboot. He is old, he can be childish but also so deep, he can be dark but also joyful. His Heavensent episode was absolutely... Awesome. a reply to: sanitizedinfo Sorry to derail the thread! God is Time, eh? Hm, that's actually pretty thought provoking. I often picture God as the result of Time, a bit like the concept of the Omega Point. But God being Time is as interesting of an idea. If entropy increases with passing time, however, doesn't that mean that God is doomed to lose coherence in the future? Proposition: What if Time (Chronos) is actually the emeny of God (Zeus), forever attempting to swallow the latter's substance? edit on 27-10-2016 by swanne because: (no reason given)
