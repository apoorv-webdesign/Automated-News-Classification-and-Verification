I'm secretly and totally in love with Naomi Wolf, since she's awake and vibrant and bright, writes amazingly well and just beautiful but the "Orlando Massacre" was a staged event. The bumbling idiots(?) imbeciles(?) morons(?) at CNN blew the lid off the farce just about as much as the BBC "journalist" did standing in front of WTC Building 7 doing a live broadcast announcing it's collapse with it still standing in the backdrop of the shot half an hour before the order came to "pull it" and the pre-set explosive demolition occurred.
Crisis actors shouldn't be recycled if you want to fool anyone with a few brain-cells functioning.
