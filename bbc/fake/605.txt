According to the criminal complaint, Harris ordered a woman at knife-point into an abandoned building in September. 
The victim, who is not being identified since she is a victim of sexual assault, told police she knew Harris from seeing him in the neighborhood before but she never knew his name and didn’t have a relationship with him.

Once inside, “she was forced to go to the second floor where Harris pushed her into a small room.” It’s there he allegedly assaulted, raped and threatened the woman. 
When she asked why he was doing it, he told her “because you’re white.” 
Harris was arrested on a series of charges including rape, sexual assault and ethnic intimidation.
