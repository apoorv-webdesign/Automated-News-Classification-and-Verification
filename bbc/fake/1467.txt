Sounds like he has our president pegged. What a shame, Obama's ineptness pushed our strategic partner in that area away with the idiotic pushing of PC policies. Duterte has a huge drug problem that is ruining his country and there is only one way to set it back on course. Yes, it's ugly and people get hurt, but cleaning the drugs out is always a hard thing to do and it must be done in order to bring about a civil society again. They should have just left him alone and not tried to tell him how to run his country. I can't believe the complete ignoramuses we have running this country. Maybe Trump can fix this screw up but it's a slim hope even for someone as able as Trump.
