Well, duh. Wheat is no longer wheat, but a gmo hybrid. Many animals are fed this knock-off food, and now their milk and meat is contaminated. Promoted as the foods to eat, people have been getting poisoned for the past 25 years. Now we see the results. The government should never have been allowed to dictate what we should eat for health, because they have a vested interest in the profits from these unhealthy foods. The only fruits and veg that will be affordable is the mutant crap that monsanto sells seeds for, that can be made to yield ten-fold versus itâ€™s counterparts. Time to move to a hippe commune!
