“That is what ‘Trump’ means to me,” she said. “It doesn’t matter if Ivanka’s name is in front of it, or Donald’s.” 
“Supporting a brand — Trump — that condones sexual assault and makes excuses for it is wrong,” said Ledford. 
Donald Trump’s daughter is not Donald Trump. Ivanka Trump has not in any way, ever, condoned sexual assault. But let’s not let little things like facts get in the way of anyone’s feelings .   
Boutique marketer Shannon Coulter was willing to forgive Ivanka Trump for campaigning for her father until the “locker room tape” emerged. 
But no more. 
“(Women) were ready to give Ivanka a pass because she’s his daughter and it’s hard to be objective about your dad,” wrote Coulter. 
“But the Trump tape just sent people over the edge,” she continued. “I think (women) took particular offense, as I did, to the fact that Ivanka tries to make feminism a part of her brand but is standing by, as an official campaign surrogate, a guy who is an alleged serial sexual assaulter of women. The disconnect was too big. And they were ready to speak up about it and flex their consumer power about it.”
