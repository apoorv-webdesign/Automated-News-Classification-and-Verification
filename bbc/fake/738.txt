This article is so confusing. In the first Quote: we see “it is very difficult to know exactly…” and “very likely to be…” and “it might be that…” and ” but we cannot be completely sure…”. Wow. So many assumptions, and no facts listed. And it has been proven in many studies that the brain functions better on ketones (from dietary fat) than it does on glucose, which the body does NOT need. In fact, ketones make the body as a whole function better and more efficiently. And now that so many people have lactose INTOLERANCE, let us not argue about our distant relatives adapting to eating dairy. Especially now that the dairy cows are fed GMO grains.
A diet based on clean, local, fresh fruits and veg as well as pastured meats is all anyone needs for good health. Grains and dairy are unnecessary for anyone, but may be enjoyed by everyone if it works for them.
