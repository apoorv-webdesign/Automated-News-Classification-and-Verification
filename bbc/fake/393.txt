The "74 year old senator from Vermont" would fit in 1917 Russia, but not America 1776. BTW there are PLENTY of founding father types around now. It is just that the statists who want freebies, and the statists that promise freebies have carried the day. Both of these groups then wonder why there aren't enough freebies to go around. Go figure.
