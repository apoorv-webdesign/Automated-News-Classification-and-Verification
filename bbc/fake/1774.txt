BREAKING: Smoking Gun! Shock “Clean Up” Order White House Gave When Hillary Emails Broke 
That action left Rovin feeling particularly guilty. He told host Sean Hannity that he finally got to apologize to Lewinsky in person after a coincidence made them neighbors. 
Rovin also said that Hillary Clinton had an affair with longtime ally and lawyer Vince Foster that lasted for years. Foster was found dead in what police said was a suicide, but speculation has always been that he was murdered. 
Part of Rovin’s “fixer” responsibilities included helping scrub Foster’s office after his death. He also said he was ordered to distract the media while Team Clinton rummaged through Foster’s office.   
Foster also said he hired Jerry Parks, an Arkansas investigator, to spy on Bill because Hillary was worried about Bill’s exploits with so many “sluts” and how that could hurt their political careers. 
Two months after Foster was found dead, Parks was found shot nine times at a stoplight in his SUV in Little Rock, Arkansas. Rovin said Parks had to die because he knew everything. 
Rovin also said he was told to keep stories quiet in one of two ways: “by trading access to the Clintons for ‘positive’ interviews or by paying the reporters.” 
Rovin also told Hannity that the “endless attention” to the alleged indiscretions of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump was what forced him to go public now.
