ALERT: Angry Locals Drive Past Refugee Center, Do the Unthinkable 
“I wasn’t going to add to all the chatter littering my news feed about this presidential election. But after Wednesday night’s debate and moving through these last few days, desperately missing my babies that were lost either by miscarriage or stillbirth, NOT by my choosing … I can’t help but pen these words,” Andrews wrote. 
“For the first time in over a year, I watched and heard Donald Trump be sympathetic, dare I say, convicted even, of what he was saying. When he said (concerning abortion), ‘That’s not OK with me’ and ‘That’s not acceptable,’ and that he would appoint pro-life Supreme Court Justices … that was it. As a Christian, my choice was clear,” she continued, referring to the GOP nominee’s stance against abortion that he asserted during the Oct. 19 presidential debate. 
At the debate, Clinton voiced her support for abortion , including partial birth abortion. Previously she had stated that a fetus does not have constitutional rights.   
Clinton’s stance on abortion is not something Andrews takes lightly, as she has seen and held a fetus outside the womb. 
“Gabrielle was small, but even at 20 weeks she had all 10 fingers, all 10 toes, she had a beautiful face with a nose, lips, eyes and ears … she even had a cute little bum,” Andrews explained. 
“She was loved and she was wanted. Unfortunately she couldn’t be saved. But thousands more, just like her, can be … just not under a Clinton presidency. Hillary Clinton would probably call this post ‘scare rhetoric’… So be it. The idea of dismembering a human child SHOULD be scary.” 
Andrews continued to explain why the government should protect all human life.
