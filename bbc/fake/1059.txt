Sounds great, but the cynic in me tells me that I’ve heard similar for the the last 3 or 4 years, that this or that is gonna happen to Obama or Clinton etc etc & of course nothing ever did. Seeing is believing. That being said, this time with the release of the latest batch of Criminal Clinton’s, Weiner & Abedin emails, I think this time there’s enough to make the mud stick. Especially now that the Intelligence Community & sections of the FBI are really pissed off. I won’t be holding my breath, but as Sir Winston Churchill once said “A week is a long time in politics”.

Moe, there are many pissed off people in the CIA, FBI & Pentagon plus a plethora who were purged, who have scores to settle with Obamination and some of them have the means. đ We may never know who really tipped off Wikileaks, it may be an inside job. 
Rumor has it the email archive folder on Weiner’s laptop was named “life insurance”. Did Weiner archive those emails for their blackmail value? Did he contemplate triggering a dead man switch? Too many questions, not enough answers. Don Spilman November 2, 2016 @ 2:29 am 
There is going to be some major shakeup. Thank you BNI I sent this immediately to my base. These are very vile evil people we are dealing with and they will react like a cornered mountain lion. The next few days are going to be interesting.
