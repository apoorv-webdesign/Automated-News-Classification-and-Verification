Twitter Freaks Out When White People Spotted Holding “Blacks for Trump” Signs 
The Bloomberg Politics Florida Poll surveyed nearly a thousand Florida residents who had either already voted or were committed to vote. The poll’s margin of error was 3 percentage points, according to the New York Post . 
Clinton may like to boast of her lead here and in other key states, but the Florida results made it clear that Americans were still in control of choosing the candidate who becomes our next commander in chief.
