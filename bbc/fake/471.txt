The Electoral College was put in place by the Founders as a safeguard against mob rule or what they called 'factions' unrepresentative of ALL Americans coming to power and taking over the government. Obviously someone as unfit and Fascist as Donald Trump meets that criterion of danger to the Republic and it only remains to see if the Electoral College will now behave with the integrity that the Founders hoped they would have.
And it is NO MORE UNFAIR for the Electoral College to say NO to American Fascism than it would be for Trump to 'win' with a MINORITY of the popular vote.
