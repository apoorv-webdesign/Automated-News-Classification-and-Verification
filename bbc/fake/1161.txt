Rigging the Election – Video IV: $20K Wire Transfer From Belize Returned – YouTube
In the effort to prove the credibility of the undercover donor featured in the videos and to keep the investigation going, Project Veritas Action made the decision to donate twenty thousand dollars to Robert Creamer’s effort.
