A helpful Corbett Report listener pointed me to the source of the Soros 60 Minutes video that emerged earlier this week: a collaborative investigation by The_Donald subreddit. This is a great example of the “open source investigation” model of collaborative research that I’ve been fostering at The Corbett Report for the past few years. So what should we be focusing our energy on next? Is there another specific, attainable research goal (like tracking down the Soros interview) that we could reasonably accomplish by combining our research resources?
