Trump Presents Plan To Expand U.S. Navy To 350 Ships 
They aren’t being asked to return the money. 
Various construction officials who built hospitals way over budget received thousands of dollars in bonuses. Other high-level VA officials directly responsible for the suffering of America’s veterans received tens of thousands of dollars worth of bonuses — and Uncle Sam isn’t asking for any of it back. 
If that doesn’t make your blood boil, you aren’t paying attention.   
This is government corruption at its absolute finest. While ordinary citizens who did their duty to this country are forced to drain their bank accounts because the government screwed up (again), executives and corrupt officials get to live large. 
Corruption like this is why Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is so popular. Washington is indeed a swamp , and he is the only one who can drain it. Someone like Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton, a 30-year insider, isn’t going to fix what is broken. 
On Wednesday morning, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced that the Pentagon would be “suspending” its program to collect the bonuses from the soldiers who had improperly received them, Fox News reported, although it was presumed that the program would be resumed once some kinks had been worked out. 
If we had a federal government that actually spent money correctly and held people accountable for mistakes, these former soldiers wouldn’t be in precarious financial situations today.
