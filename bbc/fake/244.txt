link So this is from an Argentinian conference Assange spoke with via telephone. He states Hillary campaign (or pro-Hillary government) attempted to attack Wikileaks servers. Assange claimed the release “whipped up a crazed hornet’s nest atmosphere in the Hillary Clinton campaign” leading them to attack WikiLeaks. “They attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the UN and British courts to accuse me of being both a Russian spy and a pedophile,” he added. He also added that he does not think the Podesta emails will have an impact, adding the influence of MSM pushing Hillary. The Podesta emails will make no difference to the election result, according to Assange. “I don’t think there’s any chance of Donald Trump winning the election, even with the amazing material we are publishing, because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with Hillary Clinton,” he said. sorry this is RT, but many won't cover this Interesting considering he implied he would have a bombshell before the election. This whole situation is so hard to read, with talks of Wikileaks being compromised, or pressure on to Ecuador trickling down to Assange. Just thought I'd share.
