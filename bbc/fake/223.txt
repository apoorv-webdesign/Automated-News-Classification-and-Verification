link Okay, we are all familiar with the theory that our universe is some sort of simulation, math that works so specifically, so well, so many predictions from math and science that are proved right more and more often etc and so on. (not going to get into "proof" google it!) So you have to ask yourself WHY would a thing, being, God, whatever want to create such a virtual simulation? We know that we as humans have the right to live and have family's, often with as many kids as sustainable (at the time). This means that however well we create food, we WILL use up all resources on this planet weather we make the best plans or not. But we cant crack viable ways to leave this planet and populate others beyond our own slowly decaying star. So what about this. What if the answer was to create a sped up reality, using all our computing and programming powers to emulate the universe (or observable universe), wait for life to grow on a planet and then give them the same problem we have so that we can reap the answer for ourselves? LEAVING THE SOLAR SYSTEM TO COLONISE OTHER SYSTEMS, INDEFINITELY. Could it be as simple as that? Love to hear your thoughts, been thinking about this for some time now.
