“No, I want that one,” asserted O’Reilly. 
“Which one in particular?” she asked. 
He didn’t care. “April or August.” 
Resume stammering: “OK. Um … let’s see. In August, um, let’s see … Um … We had comments that you were going to …‘If someone is being really dishonest,’ referring to the press corps, you would strip them of their credentials as well. It doesn’t sound like an independent thing …” 
Nor does it sound like anything remotely related to what O’Reilly asked for. 
“That doesn’t have anything to do with ‘Lock her up,'” he said. “You are ill-prepared for this interview, Miss Rubin.” 
“No, I’m not. I have a list here,” she said. 
A list from which she was utterly, laughably unable to produce the one thing she was asked for. 
“Miss Rubin,” said O’Reilly, “I have just given you a minute where you hemmed and hawed. You said I justified a comment, ‘Lock her up.’ You can’t point to it. And then you pivot to something else. You are ill-prepared for this. And this is the point I want to make. Your column and blog are a fraud …” 
She then threatened to put the list up on her blog which, according to NewsBusters , never happened. 
Watch the interview; seriously, it’s fun.
