link a reply to: ghostrager Two YouTubers I know of, I'm not mentioning who they are, have been promoting the notion he's dead. It didn't ring true for me because if he was I believe it would be known by all very quickly via the internet. He has close friends and family who I doubt would want it to be kept secret. That's my perception anyway. He really is isolated as I've mentioned before. I hope he makes it through. He's brilliant and has done a great service for regular people in a frightful world based upon lies, ugly secrets and deceptions.
