You know I was in Subic Bay (U.S. Merchant Marine attached to the U.S. Navy base ) for half of 1988,... and at that juncture "Shabu" (Chystal-Meth) was just becoming a prominent issue in that country... These days,... after quite a few years of living (part time) in Tampico, Mexico I decided some years back that it was getting too "out of control"/risky to be doing that anymore... I started researching, and taking a look at the Philippines again, but found that now Shabu is so pervasive in that culture that they estimated that perhaps 10 percent of the population is hooked on it The irony to me is that CHINA was reported to be the primary source of Shabu, yet now Duterte is warmly snuggling up, and uber-pandering to the VERY SAME monsters who supply the poison to the afflicted Pinoy druggies that Duterte is so enthusiastically murdering en mass Hey,... I myself believe that such extreme measures (societal mass-purging of malignant criminal elements) could very well be a legitimately necessary imperative (in the short term... ) for a few years when mass-addiction/pervasive criminality has swelled so mush out of control, but I am yet incrementally beginning to smell a rat... If Dutertes' N.P.A./Communist connections are a harbinger of things to come, and if his authoritarian orientation, and unfettered homicidal compulsions become more pronounced as time goes on,... we may be left witnessing the birth of a Filipino analog to Hugo Chavez,... but this time it will be "Hugo on Steroids" I sincerely, and fervently, pray/hope that this will not be the case
